## üöÄ The Vision

Inspired by my work at **Surgical Safety Technologies (SST)** and grounded in my PhD research on the cognitive neuroscience of effort, this project addresses a critical challenge in patient safety: how can we proactively monitor a surgeon's cognitive state to mitigate the risks of fatigue and overload?

This R Shiny application simulates a "Cognitive Black Box"‚Äîa real-time analytics platform that translates complex data streams into simple, actionable insights.

## ‚ú® Key Features

* **Real-Time Simulation:** The dashboard simulates a live, second-by-second data stream from a multi-hour surgical procedure.
* **Multimodal Data Fusion:** Ingests and processes multiple data types simultaneously:
    * **Physiological:** Pupillometry data as a biomarker for neural gain and cognitive load.
    * **Motor Control:** A novel "grip force variability" metric, hypothesized to be a proxy for attentional lapses.
* **Machine Learning Core:** Uses a trained **XGBoost** model to classify the surgeon's cognitive state into one of four categories: *Optimal*, *High Load*, *Fatigued*, or *Attentional Lapse*.
* **Explainable AI (XAI):** Includes a "Why" panel powered by **SHAP** values that explains in plain language which data signals are driving the current prediction, ensuring the model is interpretable and trustworthy.
